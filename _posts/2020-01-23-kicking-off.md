Setting myself a 2020 goal to write up a blog of random tech items which I've picked up over the years - All going well it'll include some data, visualisation and software engineering pieces.

Got my inspiration from [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) where he presents the use of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
